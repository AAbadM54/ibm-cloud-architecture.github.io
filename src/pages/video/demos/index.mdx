### **Application Modernization**

Application modernization is the journey of moving existing 
applications to a more modern cloud-native infrastructure.

1. **Runtime modernization** moves an application to a 
'built for the cloud' runtime with the least amount of 
effort. This 
[video](https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Cloud+Pak+for+Applications+-+WebSphere+Runtime+Modernization/1_x1xntvmz)
demonstrates the runtime moderniztion solution described
[here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/liberty/).

2. **Operational modernization** gives an operations team the 
opportunity to embrace modern operations best practices 
without putting change requirements on the development team. This
[video]() is coming soon to demonstrate the operational 
modernization solution described 
[here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/cloudpak-for-applications/was90/).
